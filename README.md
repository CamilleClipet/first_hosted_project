# A project for using Firebase to host a website and an associated database (to store emails for a newsletter)

## Aim

The aim was to learn how to host a website on Firebase and see if it could be used as a simple database solution.
Additionally, I set up the Firebase Hosting Github Action, which allows to deploy to a new preview channel for every PR.

## Resources

The template comes from [ThemeWagon](https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-4-html5-responsive-photography-website-template-alime/) (the image is mine though) and I followed [TechTrench](https://techtrench.org/) tutorial.

## Discussion

I have concerns about the security such a database offers. The explanations given on the Firebase website about the security rules are unclear. I'll try to dig deeper, if someone knows nore about it don't hesitate to let me know.
